# code-louisville-first-project
First Official Project for Code Louisville
This webpage is the final project for the Code Louisville front end Web development course.
This site is a simple baked goods company page, that only has 3 pages.
Below is a checklist on the requirements for the site and what was done to confirm those requirements.
original Javascript File:
The file (prog.js) is the original javascript file that was made to create the slideshow.
CSS selectors:
Trust me, there are several css rules and classes and ID's used throughout this site.
Comments:
There are around 4 comments placed into the CSS page indicating which rules are related to which parts of the pages.
Responsiveness:
As the page increases in size, the flex-basis of the nav-bar increases in percentages as does the text-alignment of the slideshow titles
moves from being left-aligned to being center-aligned. The overall text size of the site also increases to compensate for the screen
increasing in size as well.
